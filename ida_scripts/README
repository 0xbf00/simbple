IDA IDC scripts to extract required information and to facilitate updating the
SBPL interpreter to future sandbox versions.

Two scripts are provided:
    - extract_filter.idc generates two output files, one containing the named
    definitions, and one containing the actual filter definitions. These files
    should be placed in sbpl/sb/filters/ and should replace the existing files
    there. Note that the auto-generated versions do not generate support code
    for derived filters, which at this time is part of the filters/definition.c
    codebase. Simply adding the static rest of the old definition to the newly
    generated file should suffice.
    - extract_ops.idc generates a single output file containing the definitions
    of sandbox operation-related data structures. The generated file should
    simply replace the provided sb/operations/definition.c file.

Note that modifiers are thus far not handled automatically, and neither are meta
filters such as "require-all". In the current implementation, these constructs
are implemented in a less modular way as compared to operations and filters, and
are therefore less easily automatically generated. Consider however, that there
are considerably fewer such constructs in the SBPL language, and it should
therefore be less time consuming to fix any issues arising from new constructs.

Both scripts use the "old" IDA IDC syntax and function interface. They have been
tested with IDA Pro 6.8 and libsandbox.1.dylib from macOS 10.12.6 (SHA1:
2e06bb92769e53d5c4467a9b51be9b9640b97bdd). Both scripts expect certain symbols
to be available and make assumptions about the makeup of internal data
structures that are potentially subject to change. In case the output of the
scripts appears to be wrong, further work is necessary. Pull requests are
encouraged.
